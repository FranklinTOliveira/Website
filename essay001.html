<h1>This is Why Iran Will Lose a Third to Half its Population in 2-5 yrs.</h1>
<p>Iran will lose a third to half its population in 2-5 yrs. Due to how it feeds its population. The story starts in the 1820s when the Shah imported new seeds from the West to improve agriculture. In later decades, a network of railroads and roads lifted Iranian food production from local self-sufficiency to a system that distributed food surpluses to locations with food deficits. However there was a catch—during both world wars, Iran suffered mass famines, as the same powers that had helped build the roads and railroads commandeered them for their own self-interest and even used them to extract additional food and other resources from the countryside.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the postwar era. With the Shah ever richer from newly arriving revenue from Iran’s oil boom, he imported vast quantities of food that could be produced cheaper elsewhere, supplying his nation with cheaper food. His opponent was the Ayatollah. In many ways, the Ayatollah was much more insane and savage than the Shah. However the one point where the Ayatollah was right and the Shah was wrong was regarding the insanity of food imports—for if the major powers were able and willing to cut the Iranian food supply, as they had shown in living memory, then how much more vulnerable would Iran be, if as the Shah had arranged, it was now dependent on them for food imports as well? Accordingly Iran under the Ayatollah strived for food self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>There were however certain blows to the pride of the Ayatollah in this regard. In the 1980s, Iranian agriculture could not really develop because the farmland was tied up in disputes between the landlords and the peasants. By the 1990s, the Ayatollahs had solved these disputes in favor of the peasants and the peasants in turn doubled Iranian food production. Food self-sufficiency however was not achieved because the population grew by 2.5. The generous welfare state initially promised by the Ayatollah was not achieved—the juicy cash payoffs went to the Ayatollahs and the IRGC. Yet subsidized food imports, subsidized gasoline and subsidized electricity remained and still remain as what is left of the welfare state for the common Iranian citizen. With this in mind, we now come to how this will all come to an end very soon.</p>

<h2>The Electric Car Revolution</h2>
<p>The key factor giving oil its value is that its energy moves goods where they need to go. The electric car changes that. For most of its history, it wasn’t much more than a very expensive toy. Yet starting in 2010 onward, the price of the battery went down from $1,000 a kWh. Once it reaches $100 a kWh, it will be cheap enough to remove cars driven by the gasoline fed into an internal combustion engine. In 2020, it’s almost there but not quite.</p>
<p>Elon Musk however says that in 2022 there will be a Tesla selling at $25,000. Now it’s true that Elon promises good things even before they are actually produced. It’s also true that there will be some time before such cars go from being part of the new cars sold to all of the new cars sold. Accordingly I refer to the analysis of Tony Seba. Tony has predicted the growth in electric cars that has occurred before it happened for over a decade. He says that in 2022 the electric car will be cost-competitive with the cars driven by the gasoline fed into an internal combustion engine and that by 2025, all new cars will be electric.</p>
<p>That tells that in 2-5 yrs., oil revenue, what’s left of it, will only continue to go downhill. The volume of oil sold doesn’t even need to go down that far for revenue to plummet due to decline in the price per barrel of oil sold. In 2014, the world market didn’t want to buy 90 million barrels of oil daily if the price per barrel was $120 and yet moving the price down to $45 per barrel only meant that oil producers worldwide were able sell an extra 5 million barrel daily.</p>
<p>In other words, in the 2014 oil crash, oil producers could choose to lose money either by discouraging buyers by charging too much or else by selling about the same volume of product for a third of the price. If that’s what the oil crash was like in 2014, then how much worse will the 2022-2025 oil crash be, due to the fact that it’s caused by the product being sold becoming more and more obsolete? Keep in mind that the Ayatollahs subsidize the importation of a third of Iran’s food when they are low on revenue and half Iran’s food when they are high on revenue. What happens to Iran when a third to half the food is gone? Presumably they aren’t dumb enough to stay in place and starve to death. Yet Iran will still lose a third to half the population because their alternative to starving to death will be to move elsewhere. Just think—there are already controversies in America and Europe on how to handle the refugee crisis!</p>
